The document object represents the content of the webpage, including the DOM (Document Object Model) structure, 
allowing you to interact with and manipulate the page's elements. On the other hand, 
the window object represents the browser window and provides control over browser-level actions and properties,
 such as opening new windows or tabs and managing the browser's history.
